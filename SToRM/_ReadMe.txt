Definition files are called definition.xml and need to be copied into the SToRM iRIC solver folder.  There is one definition.xml file for each version of SToRM.  Copy it to the solvers\storm_v1 folder and remove the '-xxx' part of the name corresponding to the SToRM version.  For example file 'definition-xsy.xml' should be renamed to 'definition.xml' after being copied to the desired solvers\storm_v1 folder.
